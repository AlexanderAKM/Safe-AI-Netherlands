          course for people who want to help close the gap between how fast AI
          capabilities are advancing and how well we can make them safe. Over
          six weeks, you&rsquo;ll diagnose why building safe AI is so
          technically hard, evaluate current safety techniques (what works,
          what doesn&rsquo;t, and where the gaps are), and map how defences
          might break by building your own &ldquo;kill chain&rdquo;. You&rsquo;ll
          leave with a fundable action plan for where your skills can make the
          biggest difference. SAIN Amsterdam supports ambitious students in
          finding their next steps in an AI safety career.

          is governed. Over six weeks, you&rsquo;ll assess the evidence,
          compare competing strategies, and test your ideas through practical
          exercises and group discussion, leaving with a concrete plan for how
          you can contribute. Because the course leans heavily on US and China
