/**
 * Course application status, per chapter.
 *
 * Single source of truth for the chapter course pages, the courses page and the
 * landing course tabs, so a cohort is never advertised as open in one place and
 * closed in another.
 *
 * To open or close a cohort: flip `open` for that chapter and edit its
 * deadlines.
 *
 * An open entry also carries `closesAfter`, the later deadline as an ISO date.
 * Every read of this file goes through `resolve` below, which reports the entry
 * as closed once that date has passed. A file nobody remembered to edit can
 * therefore go quiet, but it can never print an expired deadline beside a live
 * apply button. The site is a static export, so "now" is the build date: a
 * rebuild is what retires a lapsed cohort.
 *
 * A chapter that takes applications all year, placing each applicant in its
 * next cohort, is open with `rolling: true` and a `rollingNote` instead of
 * deadlines. It has no date to lapse on, so it stays open until someone closes
 * it here.
