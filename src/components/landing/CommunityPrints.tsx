 * this band once had: the gallery grows as photographs come in, and a scatter
 * only holds a fixed number. The next print showing past the edge is the
 * affordance on touch, which is why there are no dots; a fine pointer also
 * gets the two paper chips. The strip bleeds to both screen edges so it reads
 * as something that continues rather than a box that ended.
 *
 * Adding a photograph: put it in public/landing as `print-<name>.jpg`, add it
 * to the community gallery entry in scripts/generate-responsive-images.mjs,
 * run `npm run images`, and add a row here.
